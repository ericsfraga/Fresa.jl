- [ ] from the manual: instead of writing
  : Complex{Float64}(x)
  write
  : complex(float(x))
  which I could use in =createpoint= in Fresa.

- [ ] find code that converts JuMP model into callable objective function and constraints functions and implement this as a test example in Fresa:
  - for instance, look at DictModel from Nonconvex.jl for transforming a JuMP model into a function based model

  - we found we had to do single decision variable neighbour definitions for the layout problem which is highly constrained.
- [X] consider a dynamic population size for multi-objective optimization problems where \(N_p \gets 2 \times N_{pareto}\) constrained by \(N_p \in [N_{p,\min}, N_{p,\max}]\)
- [ ] It would be interesting to see a plot of the evolution of solutions (e.g. draw vectors from original point to neighbour found).  This could be done for the reactor operation example I presented at IChEAP14 and EGL-B as it has only three values in the decision vector.
- [ ] consider implementing Christopher Taylor's algorithm(s) for more efficient non-dominated sort ranking which may be O(n^2).
- [ ] use a grey code for defining neighbours for integer programming; consider the C1P problem for instance.
- [ ] could we use a hyper-volume of space dominated by a solution as a means of ranking?  There would be difficulty in having a ranking that does not penalise extrema, mind you.
- [X] try using ~pmap~ for parallel processing, as described in [[file:~/s/notes/notes.org::*using%20pmap%20for%20parallel%20processing][note on using pmap for parallel processing]], mapping solutions to Points; alternatively, could use ~@sync @parallel for i=1,...~.  There's a note on this: [[file:~/s/notes/notes.org::*threads%20and%20parallel%20loops%20in%20Julia][threads and parallel loops in Julia]].
  - actually ended up using multithreading instead as it fits the solution procedure better.
- [ ] use constraint information in fitness calculations
- [X] Pareto set should not include infeasible points (unless all are infeasible?)
- [X] keep Pareto set as elite
- [X] current version requires =f= to return a vector for objective function value.  A single objective function should not require this so need to catch this case.
- [X] consider splicing out the selected member from the population
- [X] parallelise the evaluation of the new members of the population
- [X] add counters to be able to display number of function evaluations etc.
- [X] allow for user specified /neighbour/ function
- [X] implement MINLP example

Creating a new package: https://www.juliabloggers.com/package-development-in-julia-1-0-using-the-repl/
- *main thing* was using =dev ~/s/research/julia/Fresa.jl= command from the =Pkg= REPL.
- need to specify dependencies in the =Project.toml= file as well.  The =uuid= for each project can be found in the =~/.julia/environments/Project.toml= file.  But I don't understand how these are updated.
There's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVmU29rCjaA][a video on developing Julia packages]].
* Overview and introduction
/Fresa/ is an implementation of a /plant propagation algorithm/ in [[http://www.julialang.org/][Julia]] programming language.  Our original version was called [[file:strawberry.org][Strawberry]], written in Octave (and usable in MATLAB).  Please see the [[file:strawberry.org][documentation]] of Strawberry for a longer description of the history of these codes, the conditions on which you may use these codes and which articles to cite.  The quite interesting story of the strawberry plant [[https://strawberryplants.org/strawberry-plant/][can be found elsewhere]].

The move to using Julia for the implementation of this algorithm was motivated by the desire to use /open source/ and /free/ (as in beer) software only while also ensuring that the tools are computationally efficient.  Octave has not kept up with developments in /just in time/ compilation and, although has some features not available in MATLAB, it is not a modern language.  Julia provides many of the capabilities of Octave while also being computationally efficient and providing many more modern features such as *built-in parallelism* and *multi-dispatch*, both of which are used by Fresa for efficiency and to make the search procedure generic with respect to data types used to represent points in the search space.

A [[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucecesf/Fresa/tutorial.html][tutorial]] example, the design of the operating temperature profile for a simple reactor, modelled as a dynamic optimization problem, is available.

** Installation
This document has been written using [[http://orgmode.org/][org mode]] in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] text editor.  Org allows for /literate programming/ and uses /tangling/ to generate the actual source files for the code.  The code, tangled from this file, can be found [[https://github.com/ericsfraga/Fresa.jl][at github]] as a Julia package.  /Fresa/ has also been registered as a Julia package in the [[https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General][General registry]].  Therefore, all you should need to install /Fresa/ is to type

: add Fresa

in [[https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/][the Julia package manager]], which you can activate by typing ~]~ in the Julia REPL.

/Fresa/ makes use of the following extra Julia packages: =Dates=, =LinearAlgebra=, and =Printf=.  These packages will be installed automatically by the Julia package manager if not already installed.  The [[tests][test problems below]] (and found in the [[https://github.com/ericsfraga/Fresa.jl/tree/master/test][test folder on github]]) may require one or more of the following extra packages: ~BenchmarkTools~, ~PyPlot~, ~Profile~.  You may need to install these explicitly to try out the test problems.

** Quick example

:END:

Once Fresa is available in your Julia installation, using it requires you to define *three* aspects to define a problem:
1. the objective function, which includes the evaluation of constraints;
2. the search domain; and,
3. an initial population.
I will illustrate how to use Fresa for a simple nonlinear problem, adapted from chapter 13 of a textbook from MIT:[fn:3:Exercise 9, page 452: https://web.mit.edu/15.053/www/AMP-Chapter-13.pdf] 

\[ \min_x z = 5 x_1^2 + 4 x_2^2 - 60 x_1 - 80 x_2 \]

subject to the following constraints

\begin{array*}
6x_1 + 5x_2 & \le 60 \\
10x_1 + 12 x_2 & \le 150
\end{array*}

and with \(x_1 \in [0,8]\) and \(x_2 \in [0,\infty]\).

We start by telling Julia that we wish to use the Fresa package:

#+name: exampleusingfresa
#+begin_src julia
  using Fresa
#+end_src

The next step is to define the objective function.  This function has two responsibilities: it must calculate the value of the objective and it must indicate whether the given point in the search space is feasible or not.  The function returns a /tuple/ consisting of ~z~, the objective function value, and ~g~, the indication of feasibility.  ~g~ should be \le 0 if the point is feasible and greater than 0 otherwise.  For constraints as in the example given above, the most straightforward approach can be to rewrite the constraints in the form \(g(x) \le 0\):
\begin{array*}
6x_1 + 5x_2 - 60 & \le 0 \\
10x_1 + 12 x_2 - 150 & \le 0
\end{array*}
With this transformation, the objective function can be written:
#+name: exampleobjective
#+begin_src julia :noweb yes :tangle no
  function objective(x)
      # calculate the objective function value
      z = 5*x[1]^2 + 4*x[2]^2 - 60*x[1] - 80*x[2]
      # evaluate the constraints so that feasible points result in a
      # non-positive value, i.e. 0 or less, but infeasible points give a
      # positive value.  We choose the maximum of both constraints as
      # the value to return as an indication of feasibility
      g = maximum( [ 6*x[1] + 5*x[2] - 60
                     10*x[1] + 12*x[2] - 150 ] )
      # return the objective function value along with indication of
      # feasibility
      (z, g)
  end
#+end_src

The second requirement is the definition of the search domain.  For flexibility, for instance to allow the use of problem specific data structures, Fresa expects the search domain to be a function of the search points.  The domain therefore is defined by providing two functions, one which returns the lower bounds for the given point in the search space and the other returning the upper bounds.  For problems involving a search in the real number domain, such as the example above, it is usually straightforward to define a box search domain.

In the example above, the second optimization variable is unbounded above.  However, looking at the constraints and taking into account the domain for the first optimization variable, we can determine that \(x_2 \le \frac{150}{12} = 12.5\) must hold for feasible points.  The search domain, for Fresa, is therefore defined as follows:
#+name: exampledomain
#+begin_src julia :tangle no :noweb yes
  dom = Fresa.Domain( x -> [ 0.0,  0.0 ],  # lower bounds
                      x -> [ 8.0, 12.5 ] ) # upper bounds
#+end_src
This code says that for any point in the search space, ~x~, the lower bounds are given by the vector ~[0.0, 0.0]~ and the upper bounds by ~[8.0, 12.5]~

Finally, an initial population must be provided to Fresa.  This population can be of any size so long as there is at least one member.  Fresa usually works well even if only one initial point in the search domain is provided.  We consider starting at the midpoint of the search domain defined above and create a ~Point~ in the search domain:
#+name: exampleinitialpopulation
#+begin_src julia :tangle no :noweb yes
  initialpopulation = [ Fresa.Point( [4.0, 6.25 ], objective ) ]
#+end_src
Defining the ~Point~ object (see [[*Point][below]]) requires two arguments: the values of an actual instance of the decision or optimization variables in the search domain and the Julia function that evaluates the objective function for the optimization problem.

Given the above code, Fresa can now be used to solve the problem:
#+name: examplesolve
#+begin_src julia :results output
  best, population = Fresa.solve( objective, # function 
                                  initialpopulation, # initial points
                                  domain = dom )     # the search domain
  println("Population at end:")
  println("$population")
  println("Best solution found is:")
  println("  f($( best.x ))=$( best.z )")
  println("with constraint satisfaction (≤ 0) or violation (> 0):")
  println("  g=$( best.g ).")
#+end_src
The arguments given here for the ~solve~ function are those that are required.  There are also a number of optional arguments, as described [[solve][in the code section below]]

#+name: examplesolution
#+begin_src julia :eval no :tangle example.jl :exports none
  <<exampleusingfresa>>
      <<exampleobjective>>
      <<exampledomain>>
      <<exampleinitialpopulation>>
      <<examplesolve>>
#+end_src

If we execute all the above lines of code in Julia (see [[file:example.jl][a Julia file with this code]]), the output will be similar to this:

The output includes details on the settings of all tunable parameters for the method (all of which can be adjusted, as noted above), the best solution in the population as it evolves, and the best in the final population along with that full population at the end.  Note that the output is formatted to be best viewed using ~org~ mode[fn:6: http://orgmode.org/] in the Emacs[fn:7: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/] text editor but the output should be readable as it is all just text.

A more complex [[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucecesf/Fresa/tutorial.html][tutorial]] example, the design of the operating temperature profile for a simple reactor, modelled as a dynamic optimization problem, is available.  This example was the basis for a paper [cite:@fraga-2019a].  It illustrates the generic nature of Fresa, allowing its application to problems with domain specific data structures.  Note, however, that the code in that paper is based on version 7 of Fresa so some small changes would be required to have it work in version 8.  See [[version]] section below for more details on the changes required in moving from version 7 to version 8.

** Version information <<version>>

- March 2023 :: *v8.0*, major upgrade with possible *breaking* changes where I have refactored the calling sequences for some functions, specifically:

  1. Optional arguments to the main interface to Fresa, the ~solve~ function, have changed:
     - ~nfmax~ has been added as a second stopping criterion.  Either this or ~ngen~ is used to determine how much work to undertake in solving the problem.  One of these must be set explicitly.
     - ~ngen~ no longer defaults to 100; instead, it is turned off and must be given a value explicitly if ~nfmax~ is not specified.
     - ~npop~ has been renamed to ~np~ and stands for /the number of solutions to propagate/ in each generation.  It is *not* the size of the population.
     - ~tolerance~ has been renamed to ~ϵ~ and is used by the next change: 
     - The /pruning/ of the population is now controlled by a new optional argument, ~issimilar~, which expects to be set to the name of a function which compares two points and return ~true~ if the two points should be considered /similar/.  If this function is defined, and if the optional argument ~ϵ~ is set to a value greater than 0 (default value is 0.0001), then pruning will take place.  The default value for ~issimilar~ is ~nothing~ so pruning is turned off by default.  Example functions suitable for assignment to ~issimilar~ are given [[prune][below]].

       The signature of the ~issimilar~ function is:

       : function issimilar( p1::Point, p2::Point, ϵ::Float64, domain::Domain)

       and two useful implementations, for real valued decision variables and real valued objective function values, are provided: ~Fresa.similarx~ and ~Fresa.similarz~.

  2. /deprecated/ the ~createpoint~ function and use the ~Point~ structure constructor directly.  ~createpoint~ is still available so this is not a breaking change although it is recommended that any call to ~createpoint~ be replaced with the instantiation of a ~Fresa.Point~ data type directly.

  3. Removed the need to pass a ~Domain~ object to the ~neighbour~ function as there are problems which are unbounded or for which the bounds are implicitly encoded in the decision variables.  This is a breaking change firstly because the ~solve~ function arguments have changed so that the ~domain~ is now an optional parameter as opposed to a required argument.  Secondly, for problem specific ~neighbour~ functions, the order of the arguments has changed to cater for the domain being an optional argument to the ~solve~ function.  Specific details follow on how to update any version 7 code to version 8.

     To update any code that worked with version 7 to now work with version 8, the key change is the call to the ~solve~ method.  Previously, the call would have been in the form

     : Fresa.solve(f, p0, domain, ...)

     where =...= indicates optional parameters.  This call would need to be changed to

     : Fresa.solve(f, p0, domain = domain, ...)

     Further, any definition of an application specific ~neighbour~ function would be changed from having an argument list

     : Fresa.neighbour(x, a, b, f)

     where ~a~ and ~b~ defined lower and upper bounds for the search domain, in version 7, would now be

     : Fresa.neighbour(x, f, domain)

     with ~domain~ being an instance of the ~Fresa.Domain~ data type.  The lower and upper bounds can be obtained by

     : a = domain.lower(x)
     : b = domain.upper(x)

     in the ~neighbour~ function.

     For problems where the domain is not required or useful, this ~domain~ argument is optional and the signature of an application specific ~neighbour~ method may be

     : Fresa.neighbour(x, f)

     where the call to the ~solve~ method can simply not provide a ~Domain~ argument if it is not necessary for identifying valid neighbouring solutions.
     
- February 2023 :: minor update to version *7.2.42* prior to the release of a new major version.
- June 2021 :: *v7.2.1*, first public release via [[https://github.com/ericsfraga/Fresa.jl][github]] and Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.5045812 [cite:@fresa]. 
- May 2021 :: *v7.1*, implemented *multithreading* in the evaluation of the population for each generation.  This introduces a new option for the =solve= method: =multithreading= which can be set to either =true= or =false= with the latter being the default.  Julia must be invoked with the =--threads= argument (or =-t= for short) with the number of threads to use or =auto= for automatic determination of the threads possible.  Multithreading is useful when the evaluation of the objective function is computationally expensive.  Otherwise, the overhead of multithreading is usually not worth it although it is not detrimental.
- April 2021 :: *v7*,
  1. the domain for the search, which has to be bounded, is now defined by [[domain][a =Domain= data structure]] which allows for different representations of solutions in the search space in a given population;
  2. allow setting the steepness of the [[adjustfitness][fitness adjustment function]].  This is an outcome of the presentation by Wouter Vrielink at the PPA mini-zoomposium I organised in March 2021 to discuss the impact of PPA parameters on the effectiveness of the search procedure.
- March 2021 :: *v6*, one of the required arguments to the =solve= function has been changed.  Specifically, the initial guess must now be a population of =Point= objects and not a single decision variable.  See [[examples][examples]] below for how to create this initial population easily.
- April 2020 :: moved all code to [[https://github.com/ericsfraga/Fresa.jl][github]].  This should make it easier for others to use the code.
- September 2019 :: *v5*, The objective function values, in the ~Point~ type, are now a generic =Vector= instead of an array of floating point numbers.  This opens up *Fresa* to be used for objective functions which are not necessarily simple scalar values.  The use case has been illustrated through a case study in stochastic optimization, specifically /design under uncertainty/.  Details available from the author.
- July 2019 :: *v4*, The returned values for ~Fresa.solve~ in the single objective case have changed.  Instead of separate returned values for the decision variables, the objective function value, etc., a single ~Fresa.Point~ value is returned for the best point found, along with the full final population as an array of ~Fresa.point~ values.
- June 2019 :: *v3*, The calling interface for using the =Fresa.solve= method has changed.  Specifically, when the search space is defined by data structures that are not a vector of =Float64= values, the user must create a =Fresa.neighbour= function definition for the specific data structure type.
- September 2017 :: *v2*, moved to an object representation for points in the search space and allowed for parallel evaluation of the objective function when multiple processors are available.
- November 2016 :: *v1*, first [[http://www.julialang.org/][Julia]] plant propagation algorithm implementation.

# +toc: headlines 2 local
The /Fresa/ method is a population based evolutionary algorithm which mimics the propagation used by plants.  Throughout the module, the population object is an array of =Point= objects.  Each point is defined by the decision or optimization variables (the /point/ in a search space), the objective function values for this point and a feasibility indication, with =g≤0= feasible and =g>0= infeasible.  See the documentation [[solve][for the =solve= method below]] for more details on the data structures used and expected.
** start of module and dependencies
Fresa depends on a number of packages that should be available in any Julia installation.  These are packages for mostly for displaying output formatted for easy viewing in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][the Emacs text editor]] using [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]].

** types
*** Point
Fresa uses one type, =Point=, which is a point in the search space.  It includes these entries:
- ~x~ :: of indeterminate type to allow for a wide range of applications (e.g. integer versus real values),
- =z= :: the value of the objective function, as a vector, where the entries in the vector can be of any type that can be /compared/ and sorted by =sortperm= [fn:1:https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/sort/index.html] or, in the case of multiple criteria, where it can be determined whether one point dominates another,
- ~g~ :: the constraint violation (feasible with ≤0 and infeasible otherwise) always of type ~Float64~ (for now), and
- ~ancestor~ :: another point in the search space, along with some extra information, that led to the creation of this point.

An instance of a point is defined by the variable in the search space, the objective function used to evaluate the point, the ancestor of this point (see below), and optional parameters to pass to that function.  

As /Fresa/ is an evolutionary procedure, every point in the search space considered will be the descendent of a previously considered point.  The sole exception is the initial starting point given by the procedure which invokes /Fresa/.  The link between points is through a backward chain defined by the ancestor entry.  This is not used by /Fresa/ itself directly but provides extra meta-information that could be useful for post-optimization analysis, e.g. to see how effective the balance between exploration and exploitation may be for the given search parameter values.

An issue in Julia (as of 2021, at least) is that you cannot define two data structures that mutually refer to each other.  Therefore, the type of the =ancestor= entry in the =Point= data structure has to be defined later (see [[ancestor][~Ancestor~ definition]] below).  This is discussed in the [[https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/269][issue for Julia on github]].

#+end_src 
Customise how a Point is displayed.  We display the objective function value(s) first and then the representation of the point.  This allows for a population to have different representations without causing problems with any data analysis on the columns representing the objective function values.
#+name: showpoint
#+begin_src julia
  import Base
  Base.show(io::IO, p::Fresa.Point) = print(io, "f(", p.x, ")=", p.z, " g=", p.g)
  # and also an array of points
  function Base.show(io::IO, p::Array{Point,1})
      np = length(p)
      if np > 0
          nz = length(p[1].z)
          println(io, "|-")
          for i=1:nz
              print(io,"| z$(i) ")
          end
          println(io, "| g | x |")
          println(io,"|-")
          for i=1:length(p)
              for j=1:nz
                  print(io,"| ", p[i].z[j], " ")
              end
              print(io, "| ", p[i].g, " ")
              print(io, "| ", p[i].x, " |\n")
          end
          println(io,"|-")
      else
          print(io,"empty")
      end
  end
#+end_src 
and also indicate that a =Point= is atomic in a sense:
#+name: pointsize
#+begin_src julia
  import Base.size
  Base.size(p :: Point) = ()
#+end_src 
*** Ancestor <<ancestor>>
The creation of any point in the search is based on one of the existing points in the population.  This existing point is known as the /ancestor/ of the new point.  The ~Ancestor~ data structure is used to connect points to their ancestors and collect information about when and how the new point was created.
#+name: ancestortype
#+begin_src julia
  struct Ancestor
      point :: Point        # the actual ancestor point
      fitness :: Float64    # the fitness of the ancestor
      generation :: Int32   # the generation when this point was created
  end
#+end_src 
Once the =Ancestor= data structure has been defined, we can now use an /access constructor/ to define the type for the =ancestor= field in the =Point= object:
#+begin_src julia
  ancestor(p :: Point) = p.ancestor :: Union{Ancestor,Nothing} 
#+end_src 
*** Domain <<domain>>
/Fresa/ assumes a bounded domain for the search.  Each design variable will have a lower and upper bound.  To provide for domain specific design variable data structures, the =Domain= structure is used.  In this structure, the =lower= and =upper= variables are functions which will be evaluated with a point in the search space and are expected to return appropriate data that the =neighbour= function (see [[neighbour][below]]) will be able to use to ensure the domain bounds are respected in the creation of new search points.  

#+name: domaintype
#+begin_src julia
  struct Domain
      lower                       # function which returns lower bound on search variable(s)
      upper                       # function which returns upper bound on search variable(s)
  end
#+end_src 

An example of a the use of this =Domain= structure is:

#+begin_src julia :tangle no
  d = Fresa.Domain(x -> zeros(length(x)), x -> ones(length(x)))
#+end_src 

which will define the domain as a unit square, \(x \in [0,1]^n\), as defined by the size of the =x= argument.
** COMMENT variables
These are variables that are global to the module.
#+name: variables
#+begin_src julia
  a = [0.0]                       # lower bounds
  b = [1.0]                       # upper bounds
#+end_src 
** create a point                                          :deprecated:
A trivial function that simply creates a new =Point= object.  This exists for two reasons:
1. It is needed for the =remotecall= functionality when using parallel computing because the =remotecall= function has to be given a function and not just a constructor (for some obscure reason that means that a constructor is transformed to a conversion operation... don't ask me).
2. The ~Point~ type is parametric.  This makes defining a generic constructor difficult (at least, I was unable to find a working solution).
The optional =parameters= and =ancestor= arguments are passed through to their respective destinations: the objective function for the parameters and the point creation for the ancestor linking.
#+name: createpoint
#+begin_src julia
  function createpoint(x,f,parameters = nothing,ancestor = nothing)
      z = 0
      g = 0
      if ! ( parameters isa Nothing )
          (z, g) = f(x, parameters)
      else
          (z, g) = f(x)
      end
      if g isa Int
          g = float(g)
      end
      p = Nothing
      if rank(z) == 1
          p = Point(x, z, g, ancestor)
      elseif rank(z) == 0
          p = Point(x, [z], g, ancestor)
      else
          error("Fresa can only handle scalar and vector criteria, not $(typeof(z)).")
      end
      return p
  end
#+end_src 
(*deprecated*) and we provide two versions with simple calling sequences:

** fitness
The fitness function used depends on the number of objectives.  For single criterion problems, the fitness is the objective function values normalised and reversed so that the minimum, /i.e./ the best solution, has a fitness of close to 1 and the worst a fitness close to 0.  For multi-criteria problems, a Hadamard product of individual criteria rankings is used to create a fitness value [[http://www.springer.com/gb/ook/9783319299730][(Fraga & Amusat, 2016)]] with the same properties: best solutions have fitness values closer to 1 than less fit solutions.

  For single objective problems, the fitness is simply the normalised

*** adjust the fitness to avoid boundaries of [0,1]    :ignoreheading:
The fitness should be a value \in (0,1), i.e. not including the bounds themselves as those values cause some silly behaviour in the definition of individual neighbouring solutions (i.e. the runners) and the number of runners.  Therefore, we adjust the fitness values to ensure that the bounds are not included.

See below for a discussion about the second function argument, =steepness=, and how the value =s= is calculated if =steepness= is a tuple and not a single value.
#+name: adjustfitness

This function takes, as an argument, the =steepness= of the transition from poor fitness to good fitness.  Some plots are useful for comparison.  This first plot shows the default fitness adjustment function which gives some emphasis to the extreme values but also ensures that the fitness values are quite some distance from the boundary of the fitness domain:
#+begin_src gnuplot :exports results :file defaultsteepness.png :cache yes
  set yrange [0:1]
  unset key
  plot [0:1] (tanh(4*1*x - 2*1)+1)/2

[[file:defaultsteepness.png]]

Making the fitness adjustment /steeper/, e.g. with a value of =steepness= of 2 instead of the default value of 1, the function has a more pronounced emphasis towards the boundaries and allows values closer to those boundaries:
#+begin_src gnuplot :exports results :file sharpersteepness.png :cache yes

  unset key
  plot [0:1] (tanh(4*2*x - 2*2)+1)/2

The steepness may be specified as a /tuple/ in which case it represents the initial value for the steepness and the final value.  The evolution of the steepness is based on a cubic with 0 slope at the start and at the end.  The following =maxima= code is the solution of the that cubic given the need to pass through the points \((0,s_1)\) and \((n_g,s_2)\) where \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are the two values of the tuple and \(n_g\) is the number of generations:

** neighbour -- generate random point <<neighbour>>
A random solution is generated with a distance from the original point being inversely proportional, in a stochastic sense, to the fitness of the solution.  The new point is possibly adjusted to ensure it lies within the domain defined by the lower and upper bounds.  The final argument is the fitness vector with values between 0 and 1, 1 being the most fit and 0 the least fit.

Fresa comes with two default methods for generating neighbouring solutions. The first is for a search space defined by vectors of =Float64= values:
#+name: neighbourarray
#+begin_src julia
  function neighbour(x :: Vector{Float64},
                     f :: Float64,
                     d :: Domain
                     ) :: Vector{Float64}
      # allow movements both up and down in the domain for this variable
      # so determine the actual domain lower and upper bounds
      a = d.lower(x)
      b = d.upper(x)
      xnew = x .+ (1.0 .- f) .* 2(rand(length(x)).-0.5) .* (b.-a)
      xnew[xnew.<a] = a[xnew.<a];
      xnew[xnew.>b] = b[xnew.>b];
      return xnew
  end
#+end_src
There is also a version that expects single valued =Float64= arguments.
#+name: neighbourfloat
#+begin_src julia
  function neighbour(x :: Float64,
                     f :: Float64,
                     d :: Domain
                     ) :: Float64
      # allow movements both up and down
      # in the domain for this variable
      a = d.lower(x)
      b = d.upper(x)
      newx = x + (b-a)*(2*rand()-1)/2.0 * (1-f)
      if newx < a
          newx = a
      elseif newx > b
          newx = b
      end
      newx
  end
#+end_src
Should other decision point types be required, e.g. mixed-integer or domain specific data structures, the =Fresa.neighbour= function with parameters of the specific type will need to be defined.  See the [[*mixed integer problems][mixed integer nonlinear examples]] below for an example of a simple mixed-integer case.

** pareto -- set of non-dominated points
Select a set consisting of those solutions in a population that are not dominated.  This only applies to multi-objective optimisation; for a single criterion problem, the solution with minimum objective function value would be selected.  This function is used only for returning the set of non-dominated solutions at the end of the solution procedure for multi-objective problems.  It could be used for an alternative fitness function, /a la/ Srinivas /et al./ (N Srinivas & K Deb (1995), Evolutionary Computation *2*:221-248).
*** <<<dominates>>>: determine dominance
To cater for generic comparisons between points in the objective function space (e.g. distributions instead of single values for each objective function), we introduce an operator used to determine /dominance/.  The community differs on the symbol to use for /dominates/.  Some[fn:4:https://oklahomaanalytics.com/data-science-techniques/nsga-ii-explained/] use ≼ (~\preceq~); others[fn:5:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28406878/about-correct-notation-of-pareto-dominance-in-optimization] use ≻ (~\succ~).  I have decide to use the latter as it gives the impression of dominating.
#+name: dominates
#+begin_src julia
  function dominates(a, b)
      all(a .<= b) && any(a .< b)
  end
  ≻(a,b) = dominates(a,b)
#+end_src 
This operator will be extended by other packages that wish to make comparisons between non-scalar values of each objective function.  The easiest way may often be to ensure that \leq and < operators are defined for the individual entries in the vector of objective function values.
*** find Pareto set
The following code splits a population into those points that are non-dominated (i.e. would be considered an approximation to a Pareto frontier) and those that are dominated.  The function returns indices into the population passed to it.

      n = length(z)
      dominance = [reduce(&, [!(z[i] ≻ z[j]) for i ∈ 1:n]) for j ∈ 1:n]

** printHistoryTrace - show history of a given solution
Each point encountered in the search, other than points in the initial population, is the result of propagating another point.  When a new point is created, a link back to its /parent/ point is created.  This allows us to explore the history of all points in the search.  This function prints out the historical trace of a given point, using an =org= table for formatting.
#+name: printhistorytrace
#+begin_src julia
  function printHistoryTrace(p :: Point)
      a = p.ancestor
      while ! (a isa Nothing)

      end
  end
#+end_src
** prune - control population diversity
Due to the stochastic nature of the method and also the likely duplication of points when elitism is used, there is often or at least sometimes the need to prune the population.  If a function, ~issimilar~, has been provided that defines a measure of similarity, this function is applied to pairs of points in the search, including their objective function values, to identify similar solutions and remove them from the population.  The similarity can make use of a tolerance, ~ϵ~.  

The ~issimilar~ function can define similarity based on the decision variables, the objective function values, or a combination of the two.  Two functions are provided below, one for decision variables and one for objective function values.

#+name: prune
#+begin_src julia
  function prune(pop :: AbstractArray, issimilar, ϵ, domain)
      l = length(pop)
      # we will return a diverse population where similar solutions have
      # been removed
      diverse = [pop[1]]
      # consider each solution in the population
      for i=2:l
          similar = false
          j = 0
          # compare this solution with all already identified as diverse
          # enough
          while !similar && j < length(diverse)
              j += 1
              similar = issimilar(diverse[j], pop[i], ϵ, domain)
          end
          if !similar
              push!(diverse,pop[i])
          end
      end
      # return diverse population and count of points removed
      (diverse, length(pop)-length(diverse))
  end
#+end_src 
*** similarx
A function that compares solutions based on the decision variables, where these variables are suitable for the difference operator, ~-~, and that the ~LinearAlgebra.norm~ function can accept this difference as an argument.  For other decision variables, e.g. a complex data type, a new similarity function will have to be defined.

To avoid considering two solutions that straddle a constraint boundary, i.e. one feasible and the other infeasible, the constraint violation, ~g~, is also considered even though the objective function values are not.

*Arguments*: ~p1~ and ~p2~ are two points in the search space to compare and ~ϵ>0~ the tolerance for similarity.
#+name: similarx
#+begin_src julia
  function similarx(p1, p2, ϵ, domain)
      norm(p1.x-p2.x) < ϵ &&      # decision variables
          norm(p1.g-p2.g) < ϵ &&  # difference in violation
          ( (p1.g ≤ 0 && p2.g ≤ 0) || (p1.g > 0 && p2.g > 0)) # both same feasibility
  end
#+end_src 

As this similarity function compares decision variables, the ~domain~ could be used to compare solutions for a relative difference based on the size of the domain.  This is left as an exercise for the reader.

*** similarz
A function that compares solutions based on objective function values, ~z~, and returns ~true~ if the two points passed are considered to be /similar/, enough that the search would benefit from not having both present in the population in terms of diversity.  This really only makes sense for an objective function space that is unimodal.  The more appropriate similarity test for multimodal objective function spaces would be comparing on the decision variables (see above).

Again, the constraint violation, ~g~, is taken into consideration in identifying similar solutions.

*Arguments*: ~p1~ and ~p2~ are two points in the search space to compare and ~ϵ>0~ the tolerance for similarity.
#+name: similarz
#+begin_src julia

** randompopulation -- for testing other methods
Create a random population of size ~n~ evaluated using ~f~.  A single point, =x=, in the search domain must be given as the domain definition is function based and the lower and upper bounds are potentially a function of the location in the space.  The =randompoint= method below is suitable for domains defined by float valued vectors.
#+name: randompopulation
#+begin_src julia
  function randompopulation(n, f, parameters, p0, domain :: Domain)
      p = Point[]                 # population object
      for j in 1:n
          # l = domain.lower(p0.x)
          # @show l
          # u = domain.upper(p0.x)
          # @show u
          # x = randompoint(l,u)
          # push!(p, createpoint(x, f, parameters))
          push!(p, Point(randompoint(domain.lower(p0.x), domain.upper(p0.x)),
                         f, parameters))
      end
      p
  end
#+end_src 
By default, the following method generates a random point within the search domain.  This does not attempt to find a feasible point, simply one within the box defined by lower, =a=, and upper, =b=, bounds.  
#+name: randompoint
#+begin_src julia
  function randompoint(a :: Float64, b :: Float64)
      x = a + rand()*(b-a)
  end
  function randompoint(a, b)
      x = a + rand(length(a)).*(b-a)
  end
#+end_src 
** select -- choose a member of the population
Given a fitness, ~f~, choose two solutions randomly and select the one with the better fitness.  This is known as a /tournament/ selection procedure with the given size, which defaults to 2 in the ~solve~ function unless given a value by caller of that function.  Other select methods are possible but not currently implemented.
#+name: select
#+begin_src julia
  function select(f, size)
      indices = rand(1:length(f), size)       # generate size indices
      best = argmax([f[i] for i ∈ indices])
      indices[best]
  end
#+end_src 
** COMMENT set bounds -- for real valued decision vectors
Used to set some of the module global variables used by many of the functions in the module.  This could have been done in the main ~solve~ function but was taken out to make testing of small parts of the module easier.
#+name: setbounds
#+begin_src julia
  function setbounds(lower,upper)
      global a = lower;
      global b = upper;
      global n = length(lower);
      # println("Size of problem: $n")
  end
#+end_src
** solve -- use the PPA to solve the optimisation problem <<solve>>

The ~solve~ function is the main (only) entry point for the Fresa optimization package.  The following details all the arguments, both required and optional, for this function:

Required arguments:
- f :: objective function.

  The calling sequence for =f= is a point in the search space plus, optionally, the =parameters= defined in the call to =solve= (see optional arguments below).

  The objective function should return a tuple consisting of two entries: the first is the objective function value(s), which must be either a scalar real value or a vector of real values, and the second a value giving the the constraint violation.  If =g≤0=, the point is considered to have satisfied all constraints for the optimization problem and hence is feasible.  If =g>0=, at least one constraint has been found to not be satisfied so the point is infeasible.  The value of =g= for infeasible points will be used to rank the fitness of the infeasible solution, with lower values being fitter, i.e. more close to being feasible.

  See the [[*Quick example][simple example]] in the introduction to Fresa.

- p0 :: initial population with at least one initial point in the search space but there can be any number of points defined intially.  There is no requirement that all the points be based on the same data structure for the decision variables.  See the [[neighbour]] function for details and the use of multiple dispatch to enable heterogeneous populations in the search procedure [cite:@fraga2021multiple].

Optional arguments:
- archiveelite :: save thinned out elite members; default value ~false~.  When solving multi-objective problems, the /elite/ set in a population is defined by the set of non-dominated points.  This set of points can grow too large and end up dominating (no pun intended) the population.  For this reason, if the set of non-dominated points grows beyond half of the population, this set will be trimmed.  If ~archiveelite~ is set to ~true~, the members trimmed will be added to an /archive/ and this archive will be updated every generation.  The archive will be added to the final population at the end of the search.
  
- domain :: search domain: will often be required but not always; default value ~nothing~.  The domain, if given, will be passed to the [[neighbour]] function which will allow neighbour generation to know about the search domain.  The domain, if defined, must be a [[domain][Domain]] object.
  
- elite :: elitism by default; default value ~true~.  The elite member (single objective problem) or members (set of non-dominated points for multi-objective problems) will automatically be part of the next generation's population if this is ~true~.  This avoids the problem with stochastic methods which identify a good solution but then lose it because of a stochastic selection mechanism.  However, the disadvantage of elitism is that it can lead to premature convergence to a sub-optimal solution.
  
- ϵ :: ϵ for similarity detection; default value 0.0001.  This will be passed to the ~issimilar~ function if diversity control is desired.
  
- fitnesstype :: how to rank solutions in multi-objective case; default value ~:hadamard~.  The following options are available for this argument:
  - :borda :: assigns fitness according to the Borda sum of the individual points ranked according to each criterion independently.  Similar to the ~:hadamard~ default.
  - :hadamard :: assigns fitness according to the Hadamard product of the individual rankings with respect to each criterion [cite:@fraga-amusat-2016a].
  - :nondominated :: uses a sorting algorithm proposed by Deb [cite:@deb-2000];

- issimilar :: function for diversity check: see [[prune]] function; default value ~nothing~.  If this function is defined, and ~ϵ>0~, the function specified will be invoked with pairs of points to identify those which are /similar/ and could be removed from the population to ensure diversity is maintained.  Two pre-defined functions are available, ~similarx~ and ~similarz~, defined [[prune][above]].
  
- multithreading :: use multiple threads for objective function evaluation; default value ~false~.

- nfmax :: number of objective function evaluations allowed; default value ~0~.  Either this argument or the next (~ngen~) must be given a positive value, i.e. greater than 0.  A value of 0 or less indicates that this stopping criterion is not used.
  
- ngen :: number of generations; default value ~0~.  Either this argument or the previous (~nfmax~) must be given a positive value, i.e. greater than 0.  A value of 0 or less indicates that this stopping criterion is not used.  
  
- np :: number of members of the population to /propagate/ every generation: this may be /constant/ (single value) or /dynamic/ (tuple); default value ~10~.  For single objective problems, values for this argument between 5 and 20 have been shown to be most effective.  For multi-objective problems, values from 40 to 100 are better.
  
- nrmax :: number of runners maximum; default value ~5~.  It is unlikely that changing this value will have any significant effect on the performance.
  
- ns :: number of stable solutions for stopping; default value ~100~.  This value is not actually used by the code but is here as a place-holder for when the identification of stability for a population is defined properly.
  
- output :: how often to output information; default value ~1~.  This value should typically not be changed.
  
- parameters :: allow parameters for objective function ; default value ~nothing~.  Any data given for this argument will be passed directly to the objective function for the evaluation of that objective function.  This allows the caller to the ~solve~ method to pass values that the objective function may require for, for example, different instances of a given optimization problem.
  
- plotvectors :: generate output file for search plot; default value ~false~.  This is used mostly by the author to investigate the effectiveness of the fitness method and selection.
  
- populationoutput :: output population every generation?; default value ~false~.  Setting this to ~true~ is useful to understand how the population of solutions evolves over time.
  
- tournamentsize :: number to base selection on; default value ~2~.  Increasing this value will lead to greater selection pressure, emphasising the selection of the most fit solutions.  If the value is too large, the balance between /exploitation/ and /exploration/ will tilt towards the former, leading possibly to premature convergence at a sub-optimal solution.
  
- steepness :: show steep is the adjustment shape for fitness; default value ~1.0~.  A colleague from the Netherlands and his group have done some studies on the effect of the steepeness of the fitness curve [cite:@vrielink2021parameter].

- usemultiproc :: parallel processing by Fresa itself; default value ~false~.  This is no longer in use.

The function expects the objective function, ~f~, an initial population, ~p0~, with at least one point, and the =Domain= for the search.  It returns the optimum, the objective function value(s) at this point, the constraint at that point and the whole population at the end.  The actual return values and data structures depends on the number of criteria:
- 1 :: returns best point as a ~Fresa.Point~ object (which includes the decision variable values, the objective function value, and the constraint value) and also the full population;
- >1 :: returns the set of non-dominated points (as an array including objective function values and constraint value) and the full population.
     

=domain= is a valid =Domain= object with appropriate functions for determining the lower and upper bounds of the search space in terms of the optimization variables.  These should be consistent with the representations use for the individual points in the search space.

If the decision vector is not an array of =Float64=, a type specific =Fresa.neighbour= function will need to be defined.  The calling sequence for =Fresa.neighbour= is =(x,a,b,fitness)= where =x=, =a=, and =b=, should all be of the desired type and the function itself must also return an object of that type.  The =fitness= will always be a =Float64=.  See the [[*mixed integer problems][mixed integer nonlinear problems]] below for an example.

The =fitnesstype= is used for ranking members of a population for multi-objective problems.  The default is to use a Hadamard product of the rank each solution has for each objective individually.  One alternative, specifying ~fitnesstype=:borda~ uses a sum of the rank, i.e. a Borda count.  The former tends to emphasise points near the extrema of the individual criteria while the latter is possibly better distributed but possibly at providing less emphasis on the Pareto points themselves.  There is also the option ~fitnesstype=:nondominated~ which bases the fitness on levels of dominance, as used by the =NSGA-II= genetic algorithm.

The size of the population, =npop=, may be a single integer value or a =Tuple= of two integer values.  The latter, which is only for multi-objective optimization problems, gives a range of possible values for the population size.  This size will be chosen dynamically within this range depending on the size of the non-dominated set at the start of each generation.  Specifically, the population will be set to 2 times that size.  This allows for sufficient diversity in the population while minimizing computation time.  It has been seen that Fresa is largely insensitive to the population size: there is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfDrQhhswLk][an interesting video]] by Marleen de Jonge & Daan van den Berg discussing the robustness of the plant propagation algorithm with respect to the parameters for the algorithm, using a slightly different version of the algorithm which does not use tournament selection but instead selects the top =npop= members of the population for propagation.

The *output* of the progress during the search is controlled by the ~output~ optional argument.  This should be an integer value that indicates how often a summary of the current population is generated and sent to standard output.  It will be the initial value used.  The value will go up in powers of 10 as the generations proceed to ensure that there is sufficient granularity without overwhelming the output file.  The default is 1 to output every generation until the 10th, then 10 until the 100th, and so on.  A value of 0 will eliminate all output from the solve method.

  """ 

  Solve an optimisation problem, defined as the minimization of the
  values returned by the objective function, `f`.  `f` returns not only
  the objective function values, an array of `Float64` values, but also
  a measure of feasibility (≤0) or infeasibility (>0).  The problem is
  solved using the Fresa algorithm.  `p0` is the initial population
  which has to have at least one member, a `Point`, and `domain`
  describes the search domain.  This latter argument is an instance of
  the `Fresa.Domain` struct which has a `lower` and an `upper` members
  which are functions to be evaluated with a current point in the
  domain.

  The return values for the solution of a single criterion problem are
  the best point and the full population at the end of the search. 

  For a multi-objective problem, the returned values are the set of
  indices for the points within the full population (the second returned
  value) approximating the *Pareto* front.

  The population will consist of an array of `Fresa.Point` objects, each
  of which will have the point in the search space, the objective
  function value and the feasibility measure.

** thinout -- make Pareto set smaller
If we use elitism, for multi-objective problems, we use the Pareto set as the elite set.  However, this set may grow to be large, causing performance challenges as well as making the search less effective at exploration, essentially getting stuck in the local area defined by this elite set.  Therefore, we need to sometimes thin out the Pareto set for its use as an elite set.

The arguments are the whole population, the fitness of the members, the indices in this population for the Pareto set and the number of elements to keep.  We keep the most fit ones.
#+name: thinout
#+begin_src julia
  function thinout(pop, fit, pareto, n::Int)
      indices = sortperm(fit[pareto])
      return pop[pareto[indices[end-n+1:end]]], pop[pareto[indices[1:end-n]]]

** simple objective function
This test uses a simple quadratic objective function, defined within.  All points are feasible within the domain defined by the lower and upper bounds.  All /Fresa/ settings are the defaults.
#+name: testsimple
#+begin_src julia :tangle test/simple.jl
  # load in the Fresa optimization package

  # the actual objective function

  # create the initial population consisting of this single point

One of the features that /Fresa/ provides is a trace of how each solution has been created.  That is, each solution has a link back to the ancestor solution that led to its creation, along with information about when this happened (the generation) and how /fit/ the ancestor solution was.  There is a function defined in /Fresa/ for outputting a history trace.  The output is in form of an =org mode= table but is simple text that can be imported into a spreadsheet program, for instance.

** mixed integer problems
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:julia: :tangle no :noweb yes
:END:

The aims of the examples in this section are to test the use of a non-default ~neighbour~ function and the use of a problem-specific type for solutions, a mixed-integer type in this case.

*** The ~MI~ structure
All the examples before this have use a vector of floating point numbers to represent points in the search space.  For many problems in process systems engineering, the search space may be defined in terms of not only floating point numbers but also integer variables, often taking on only binary values, 0 or 1.  To cater for such optimization problems, we can ask Fresa to use a space defined by points represented using a specific data structure:

#+name: mistructure
#+begin_src julia
  struct MI
      x :: Vector{Float64}
      y :: Vector{Int}
  end
#+end_src

where ~x~ are the floating point or real numbers defining a point in the search space and ~y~ the integer numbers.

Using any data structure to represent points in the search space, other than a vector of floating point numbers, requires defining a method for identifying neighbouring solutions (see [[neighbour]] above).  We can make use of the default ~neighbour~ function to manipulate the floating point numbers but will need to handle the integer values directly.

#+name: mineighbour
#+begin_src julia
  function Fresa.neighbour(s :: MI,
                           f :: Float64,
                           d :: Fresa.Domain) :: MI
      # find the lower and upper bounds on all variables
      a = d.lower(s)
      b = d.upper(s)
      # use the neighbour function in Fresa to find a neighbour for the
      # floating point numbers in the representation of the current
      # point; the domain is defined by the real parts of the overall
      # domain, a and b retrieved above.
      x = Fresa.neighbour(s.x, f, Fresa.Domain(x -> a.x, x -> b.x))
      # the integer variables are treated differently.  We only consider
      # changing any value at all if the random number is greater than
      # the fitness value, which means that the most fit solutions will
      # likely not have the integer values changed.  If one is to be
      # changed, we limit to just one variable at a time.
      y = copy(s.y)
      if rand() > f
          i = rand(1:length(y))
          # consider the case of binary variables as special cases:
          # toggle the boolean value (which is essentially what a binary
          # variable can be considered to be); otherwise, change value
          # up or down randomly.
          if a.y[i] == 0 && b.y[i] == 1
              # binary variable
              y[i] = 1 - y[i]
          else
              # for the integer variable we select to change, we move in one
              # direction or the other a random number of places depending
              # on fitness
              positive = rand(Bool)
              # random number to decide how much change to make to this
              # integer
              r = rand()
              inc = ceil(f*r*(y[i]-y[i])/2)
              # @printf(": neighbour: positive=%s inc=%d\n", positive, inc)
              y[i] = y[i] + (positive ? inc : -inc)
              # keep within bounds
              y[i] = y[i] < a.y[i] ? a.y[i] : (y[i] > b.y[i] ? b.y[i] : y[i])
          end
      end
      # return the new search point consisting of both the floating
      # point numbers and the integer numbers
      return MI(x,y)
  end
#+end_src

**** COMMENT random points for mixed integer problems
For testing, I have also defined functions to generate random points for mixed-integer problems:

#+name: mirandompoints
#+begin_src julia
  function Fresa.randompoint(a :: Int, b :: Int)
      rand(a:b)
  end
  function Fresa.randompoint(a :: Vector{Int}, b :: Vector{Int})
      @assert length(a) == length(b)
      [rand(a[i]:b[i]) for i in 1:length(a)]
  end
  function Fresa.randompoint(a :: MI, b :: MI)
      MI(Fresa.randompoint(a.x, b.x),
         Fresa.randompoint(a.y, b.y))
  end
#+end_src
*** Example 1: Westerlund & Westerlund
The MINLP example comes from: Tapio Westerlund & Joakim Westerlund, /GGPECP -- An algorithm for solving non-convex MINLP problems by cutting plane and transformation techniques/, Proceedings of ICHEAP-6, Pisa, June 2003.  It has one real variable and one integer variable.  The search region is non-convex, consisting of two disjoint domains.

#+name: mitest1
#+begin_src julia
  # objective function and constraints
  f = s -> (3s.y[1] - 5s.x[1],
            max(2s.y[1] + 3s.x[1] - 24,
                3s.x[1] - 2s.y[1] - 8,
                2s.y[1]^2 - 2*√s.y[1] + 11s.y[1] + 8s.x[1] - 39 - 2*√s.x[1]*s.y[1]^2))
  # bounds
  d = Fresa.Domain(x -> MI([1.0], [1]),
                   x -> MI([6.0], [6]))
  # create the initial population consisting of a single MI point
  p0 = [Fresa.Point(MI([1.0], [1]),f)]
  # now invoke Fresa to solve the problem
  best, pop = Fresa.solve(f, p0; domain=d, ngen=100, populationoutput=true)
  println("Population: $pop")
  println("Best: f($(best.x)) = $(best.z), $(best.g)")
#+end_src 

Using the results obtained above, we use the linking information for all the points in the search space encountered to do some simple analysis of the search.  The simple analysis consists of printing out the path of evolution that led to the final best solution:

#+name: mitest1evolution
#+begin_src julia
  println("#+plot: ind:3 deps:(2) with:\"linespoints pt 7\" set:nokey set:\"yrange [0:1]\"")
  ancestor = best.ancestor;
  while ancestor != Some(nothing) && ! (ancestor isa Nothing)
      global ancestor
      println("| $(ancestor.point.z) | $(ancestor.fitness) | $(ancestor.generation) |")
      ancestor = ancestor.point.ancestor
  end
#+end_src 

# tangle all of the above to the test file
#+begin_src julia :tangle test/minlp.jl
  using Fresa
  <<mistructure>>
      <<mineighbour>>
      <<mitest1>>
      <<mitest1evolution>>
#+end_src 

*** Example 2: Quesada & Grossmann
The second MINLP example comes from: Ignacio Quesada & Ignacio E. Grossmann, /An LP/NLP based branch and bound algorithm for convex MINLP optimization problems/, Computers & Chemical Engineering *16*:10-11, 937-947, 1992.  This problem has one integer (binary) variable and 2 continuous variables.

#+name: mitest2
#+begin_src julia
  # objective function and constraints
  f = s -> (10*s.x[1]^2 - s.x[2] + 5*(s.y[1] - 1),
            max(
                s.x[2] - 5*log(s.x[1]+1) - 3*s.y[1],
                s.x[1]^2 - s.x[2] - s.y[1] - 1,
                s.x[1] + s.x[2] + 20*s.y[1] - 24,
                3*s.x[1] + 2*s.x[2] - 10
            ))
  # bounds, avoiding the absolute lower bound at -1 on the x variables
  # as this will cause numeric difficulties with the log function. eps()
  # is a built-in function which is the machine precision.
  d = Fresa.Domain(x -> MI([-1.0+eps(), -1.0+eps()], [0]),
                   x -> MI([50.0, 50.0], [1]))
  # create the initial population consisting of a single MI point
  p0 = [Fresa.Point(MI([0.0, 0.0], [1]),f)]
  # now invoke Fresa to solve the problem
  best, pop = Fresa.solve(f, p0; domain=d, ngen=10_000)
  println("Population: $pop")
  println("Best: f($(best.x)) = $(best.z), $(best.g)")
#+end_src 

# tangle all of the above to the test file
#+begin_src julia :tangle test/minlp2.jl
  using Fresa
  <<mistructure>>
      <<mineighbour>>
      <<mitest2>>
#+end_src 

With this code, ~Fresa~ is able to find a good solution typically within ten to twenty generations.  The example has a stopping criterion of one thousand generations and most of the extra search serves to refine the solution.  The optimum for this problem is on one (or more?) of the constraints and getting right up to the constraint is challenging for meta-heuristic methods such as Fresa.  However, the solution found within 10-20 generations is usually (maybe always) well within 1% of the optimum value.
** a GAMS interface example
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:julia: :tangle "test/gams.jl"
:END:
[[https://www.gams.com/][The GAMS]] modelling system is used by many to write and solve optimization problems and many different solvers are available, including both local and global optimizers.  However, there are some problems for which the solvers may not be able to find good solutions.  Fresa may provide a suitable alternative solver for such problems.  However, one of the best features of GAMS is that the model can be represented purely by the equations without the need to determine an evaluation sequence for these equations given a decision vector.  It is therefore desirable to consider using Fresa with GAMS models.

This example implements an objective function which invokes GAMS to solve the model given values for some decision variables.  This interface to GAMS requires writing and reading from files so will not be appropriate for small models due to the overheads in file access.

The files for this example can be downloaded: [[file:test/gams.jl][Julia code]] and [[file:test/gamsdeclarations.gms][GAMS model]].
*** the GAMS model
We use, as an example, problem 8.26 in "Engineering Optimization" by Reklaitis, Ravindran and Ragsdell (1983).  This problem seeks to minimise the square of the decision variables while minimising a residual value =res=.  We treat this as a multi-objective problem which cannot be done directly in GAMS.  By looking at it as a multi-objective problem, we can gain insight into the trade-offs between the residual and the primary objective function.

*** a multi-objective function with interface to GAMS 
The objective function for Fresa takes the decision variables, ~x~, and uses these to set the GAMS model variables ~X1~, ~X2~, and ~X3~.  After solving the GAMS model, the results, consisting of the objective function value ~Z~ and the residual, ~res~, are output to a file for subsequent reading into the Julia code.  The absolute value of the residual is used as a second criterion.
